        Hi! My name is Shree Khambekar, and I am currently a student at the University of
        Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). I am a double major in Computer Science and
        Mathematics &amp; Statistics, both Bachelor of Science. Aside from academics,
        I enjoy accomplishing things on-campus. I have done computer science and
        mathematics tutoring where I earned the "Tutor of the Month" award,
        organizational presidency for 130+ members where I was a finalist for the
        "Emerging Leader of the Year Award", and research on efficiency of AI Voice
        Cloning Detection methods where I presented my findings at UMKC's Research symposium.
        I have also gotten involved off campus in retail, where I've worked
        as a retail store manager during school breaks. Recently, I was chosen to
        represent UMKC for the Computing and Engineering department's re-accredidation
        through ABET. Currently, I volunteer as a language partner through UMKC's
        Applied Language Institute (ALI) for students learning English. I am also a
        part of UMKC's Professional Career Escalators (PCE) Scholarship Program which
        builds members' professional skills for future career success. Lastly, I am 
        a Senator for UMKC's School of Science and Engineering (SSE), where
        I advocate for SSE Students in the Student Government. I am proficient in Python,
        C++, HTML, and CSS. I have also worked with JavaScript, MySQL, React, PHP, and
        Machine Learning frameworks. I am a recipient of numerous scholarships for
        tuition assistance, and have made the Dean's List every year in college due to my 
        consistent outstanding academic performance. I am passionate about learning,
        having a presence, and making an impact in my community. I plan to pursue
        computer science careers that have an emphasis on math.
